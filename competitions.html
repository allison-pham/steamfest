            <h3>College/Career Prep Bingo</h3>
            <p><b>June 10, 2024</b> to <b>June 23, 2024</b></p>
            <p>Participants will complete 9 tasks related to either college prep or post-grad (getting a job) prep. Which card to complete will be determined by whether they are in high school or not. For college prep, tasks range from attending events at TSB that cover the topic to going on a college visit. For post-grad prep, tasks range from attending events at TSB that cover the topic to creating and refining their LinkedIn account. We hope to be able to give a prize to everyone who completes a card. If we do not have enough prizes, we will do a drawing.</p>
